# Figma---Bird-project
From My course Human computer interaction. 

Very basic designs made in Figma during design courses at Stockholm University. 


Recyclefy - Finding nearest recycling station. My first design in figma.

BirdStalker - Birdwatching app. My second design together with my group in the course. More interactive with different functions in the app.
